# Undergraduate Independent Research Project
A MATPOWER Modeling Framework for the Future New England Grid System

The overall objective of my undergraduate independent research project was to create a modeling framework to understand how increasing renewables and retiring coal, oil, and nuclear power plants will affect the New England grid system.  The model is built using MATPOWER MOST and the IEEE 39 Bus Case System.
